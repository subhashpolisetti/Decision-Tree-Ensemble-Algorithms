        "# Machine Learning Model Comparison on Breast Cancer Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook compares the performance of various machine learning algorithms for classification on the **Breast Cancer** dataset. The models tested include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Decision Tree Classifier**\n",
        "- **Random Forest Classifier**\n",
        "- **AdaBoost Classifier**\n",
        "- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**\n",
        "- **XGBoost Classifier**\n",
        "- **LightGBM Classifier**\n",
        "- **CatBoost Classifier**\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Steps:\n",
        "1. **Dataset Loading and Preprocessing**:\n",
        "   - The Breast Cancer dataset is loaded using `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()`.\n",
        "   - The dataset is split into training and test sets, with 80% used for training and 20% for testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Model Training**:\n",
        "   - Several models are trained on the training data using different algorithms, including decision tree-based methods (Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Model Evaluation**:\n",
        "   - After training, each model is evaluated on the test set using accuracy as the performance metric.\n",
        "   - The accuracy of each model is compared and displayed.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Results:\n",
        "The accuracy of the models on the test set is as follows:\n",
        "- **Decision Tree Accuracy**: 0.95\n",
        "- **Random Forest Accuracy**: 0.96\n",
        "- **AdaBoost Accuracy**: 0.97\n",
        "- **Gradient Boosting Accuracy**: 0.96\n",
        "- **XGBoost Accuracy**: 0.96\n",
        "- **LightGBM Accuracy**: 0.96\n",
        "- **CatBoost Accuracy**: 0.97\n",
        "\n",
        "This comparison provides insights into the effectiveness of different ensemble methods for classification tasks.\n"
