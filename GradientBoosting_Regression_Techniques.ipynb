        "# Comparison of Gradient Boosting Models: XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost on California Housing Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates the implementation and comparison of three popular gradient boosting algorithms—**XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, and **CatBoost**—on the **California Housing dataset**. The goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of these models for a regression task using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Dataset**:\n",
        "The **California Housing dataset** contains information about various districts in California, including attributes like median income, housing median age, average rooms, and population. The target variable is the **median house value** for each district.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Gradient Boosting Models**:\n",
        "We train and evaluate the following models:\n",
        "   - **XGBoost**: A highly efficient and scalable gradient boosting algorithm, widely used for machine learning tasks.\n",
        "   - **LightGBM**: A gradient boosting framework that uses a histogram-based approach to improve speed and memory efficiency.\n",
        "   - **CatBoost**: A gradient boosting algorithm developed by Yandex, which handles categorical features and has a focus on speed and performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Training**:\n",
        "Each model is trained using the same set of training data:\n",
        "   - **Training Parameters**: Each model is trained with 100 estimators (trees), a learning rate of 0.1, and a maximum tree depth of 3 to prevent overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Evaluation**:\n",
        "The models are evaluated using the **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** metric on the test set:\n",
        "   - RMSE is a commonly used metric to evaluate the performance of regression models, with lower values indicating better predictive accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Results:\n",
        "The performance of each model is compared by printing the RMSE values:\n",
        "   - **XGBoost RMSE**: Measures the RMSE of the XGBoost model.\n",
        "   - **LightGBM RMSE**: Measures the RMSE of the LightGBM model.\n",
        "   - **CatBoost RMSE**: Measures the RMSE of the CatBoost model.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Libraries Used:\n",
        "- `XGBoost`: For training and evaluating the XGBoost model.\n",
        "- `LightGBM`: For training and evaluating the LightGBM model.\n",
        "- `CatBoost`: For training and evaluating the CatBoost model.\n",
        "- `scikit-learn`: For data preprocessing, splitting the data into training and test sets, and calculating the RMSE.\n",
        "- `pandas`: For handling data manipulation (if necessary).\n",
        "- `numpy`: For numerical computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Final Thoughts:\n",
        "This notebook helps to understand the relative performance of different gradient boosting algorithms on a real-world regression task. XGBoost and LightGBM show competitive results, while CatBoost, although powerful, performs slightly worse on this specific dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feel free to experiment with hyperparameter tuning or different datasets to see how these models perform under different conditions!\n"
